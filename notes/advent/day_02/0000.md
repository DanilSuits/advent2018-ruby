I got burned badly on part one of this problem.

What I did was write a single acceptance test, to check
that my program could produce the write result given
the example data.

What I did not do:

First, I didn't actually write any unit tests for the
code I was operating on.  Which is to say, I didn't
explore the boundaries of the problem space to check
for hidden dangers

Second, I didn't make any attempt to produce additional
samples to check.  In particular, I didn't write any
tests to ensure that the commute properties of my
calculation were correct.

What I should have recognized is that I was dealing
with a fold over a commutative operation, and therefore
I should get the same answer is I shuffle the rows in
interesting ways.

With 7 lines of sample data, there are only 5040 different
permutations to check.  That could have been done relatively
easily.  I probably could have discovered the problem by
enumerating the 7 rotations.  Or maybe even by simply
reversing the list.

There was a similar trap in the handling of the signatures
of the individual lines.  I happened to write that code
without any clever, and thereby managed to accidentally
get it right on the first try.
