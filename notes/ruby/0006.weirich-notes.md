# Braces vs Do/End

```ruby
  # block used only for side effect
  list.each do |item| puts item end

  # Block used to return test value
  list.find { |item| item > 10 }

  # Block value used to build new value
  list.collect { |item| "-r" + item  }
```

# Python and Ruby

> In Ruby, the construct "x.y" means send a message named "y" to the object 
> represented by "x". All operations on an object must be done through the 
> sending of a message. 

> You see, there are no "functions" in Ruby. At least not in the way the
> question assumes. Rubyâ€™s unit of execution is a method, and methods are not 
> first class objects in Ruby. If you wish to have a callable object that 
> references a method on a particular object, then that is easily accomplished 
> by asking the object for a Method object. 

```ruby
  o = Object.new
  m = o.method(:to_s)
  m.class              # => Method
 ```
 
> Note the difference between a method (an internal Ruby construct) and a 
> Method object (an object that represents the internal method bound to an 
> instance). To "call" a method object (or any callable object in Ruby), 
> you send the object the "call" message. So, the result of calling m should 
> be identical to the result of sending to_s to o directly. And we see that it is. 

```ruby
  m.call               # => "#<Object:0x401c8618>"
  o.to_s               # => "#<Object:0x401c8618>"
```
