```bash
bundle gem advent2018 --test minitest
cd advent2018/
git remote add origin https://github.com/DanilSuits/advent2018-ruby.git
git fetch
git reset origin/master
```

I suppose the more organized way to do this would have been

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanilSuits/advent2018-ruby.git advent2018
bundle gem advent2018 --test minitest
cd advent2018
```

`Bundler` is smart enough to notice when a file is already in place, and
offers a menu of options to deal with it.

```bash
rm LICENSE.txt
git checkout -- LICENSE
```

Because I had done a `git reset`, the original LICENSE file was missing.

The license needed to have my name added to it

I decided to throw away the `.gitignore` file produced by github; it
has too much stuff I don't recognize.  Since this is a learning exercise,
I should add entries to that file deliberately.
