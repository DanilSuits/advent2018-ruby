> Returns a new hash containing the contents of other_hash and 
> the contents of hsh. If no block is specified, the value for 
> entries with duplicate keys will be that of other_hash. Otherwise 
> the value for each duplicate key is determined by calling the 
> block with the key, its value in hsh and its value in other_hash.

In other words, **the block is only called for duplicate keys**.
